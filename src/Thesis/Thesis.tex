\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) cables represent a leading technology for power transmission on very long distances. Currently, these cables connect different countries and islands through a network of submarine lines over hundreds kilometers long. At these lengths, alternate current cables suffer significant energy losses due to capacitive currents. Despite the high costs to convert form direct to alternate current and vice-versa at the terminals of HVDC cables, the latter are economically convenient already at 50 Km, in the case of submarine lines. There are also examples of HVDC overhead lines though they are less common.\\
The typical HVDC cable structure involves a core of conductive material like copper, with a typical cross-section of about 15 cm\textsuperscript{2}. The latter is encompassed by a thick layer of insulating material. The next layer consists of lead sheath, acting as a water barrier and a grounding for the electrical potential. The outer layers have mostly mechanical and anti-corrosion purposes. A typical overall diameter is about 12 cm.\\
Given the tendency towards very high voltages is the insulator represents a main concern when designing a HVDC cable. Different materials were considered in the past and today there is ongoing research in this field.
\subsection{Mass-Impregnated Cables}
The most consolidated and common insulation system for HVDC cables is referred to as mass-impregnated paper. It is obtained wrapping helically around the core hundreds of layers of pre-dried electrotechnical paper. The tape is usually about 2 cm wide, and on each layer, the helicoidal pitch of the tape is approximately 1 mm larger than the tape width, so that small gaps, called \textit{butt gaps}, appear. This is meant to avoid paper jamming when the cable bends. Moreover, adjacent tape layers are staggered so that butt gaps cannot be stacked.\\
The wrapped paper is then impregnated with a high-viscosity compound based on mineral oil and known as \textit{mass}. Here this compound will be called simply \textit{oil}. The internal structure of dried paper presents irregular fibers leaving room for a network of void channels that are filled with oil through an appropriate procedure. Butt gaps are also filled with oil. Finally, thanks to the roughness of the tape surface, little gaps are generated between adjacent paper layers. In the impregnation procedure also these gaps are filled with oil.\\
This insulation system has proven to be quite durable and effective. Also, whenever the line route involves different depth levels the high viscosity of the mass avoids drainage of fluid towards the lower levels \cite{ancient_and_modern_cables}. Nonetheless there are some drawbacks: for example, cavitation phenomena may arise for the oil at low temperature, reducing the breakdown strength of the insulator. Cavitation is mainly due to the high temperature of paper and oil during the impregnation procedure and their different thermal expansion coefficients. Insulation with low viscosity oil represents an alternative that avoids cavitation, but suffer drainage and fluid leakage, and also require apposite pumping units onshore to pressurize the fluid.
\subsection{Polypropylene and Polyethilene Solid Insulation}
More recently, different technologies for the insulation system based on polyethilene and polypropylene have been proposed. These cables are easier to handle and lighter with respect to MI cables, representing a valid alternative. However from a modeling perspective they show a more complex behavior, as different non-linearities arise when the insulating dielectric is stressed with very high voltage.

Numerical simulations implementing those physical models can help to predict the reliability of an insulating system like these. A very general model considering also the non linearity in the PPL cables has been proposed for the modelling of HVDC insulating materials. From that model many simplifications can be done to obtain a more affordable system to solve. At the same time many materials such as MI paper (where no charge trapping phenomena arise) can be derived as a sub-case of the general model.

In a previous project a simple model consisting in a couple of PDEs, was considered. The two variables of the system were voltage and free charge, while only the instantaneous polarization process was embedded in the system. On the other hand it is common even for simple materials to exihibit a time-dependent response, which can be accounted for by the so called Debye relaxation model. In research, this and other classes of electromagnetic problems have catalyzed the development of the so called \textit{Finite Difference Time Discretization} with \textit{Auxiliary Differential Equation} method (ADE-FDTD) \cite{ADE-FDTD}. The idea is to introduce auxiliary variables and relative differential equations simulating a relaxation mechanism. The solution proposed here is analogous to ADE-FDTD method, but also presents some differences. Here, for the spatial discretization, a finite element approach is adopted which will be described later. Moreover, while in ADE-FDTD algorithms, the employed as auxiliary variables are polarization vectors associated to a certain frequency (\(\mathbf{P}_k\)), here we use the simple polarization charges (\(\pi_k=-\nabla \cdot\mathbf{P}_k\)). \cite{hakonseththesis}




\section{Mathematical Model}
In this section we start introducing a simple model for dielectric materials coming directly from Maxwell equations with the assumption of electro-quasi-static regime. As anticipated, to obtain a more precise simulation, particularly in transient regimes, slow polarization must be taken into account. To this end Debye relaxation model is adopted. This will add to the original system a new pack of equations and variables describing the dynamics of polarization charges. In the next sections we will only focus on this model with slow polarization processes. Nonetheless  here we go further introducing a model for the conductivity, which is typically dependent on electric field intensity and on temperature. Finally we present a very general model considering also deep charge trapping phenomena, arising in polymer based insulating materials. We conclude presenting boundary conditions for the model with slow polarization processes.
\subsection{A first simple model}
We start from Gauss and Ampère-Maxwell laws

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{div}\  \mathbf{D}  = \rho 
	\label{eq:Maxwell1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{curl}\ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{j} + \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}.
	\label{eq:Maxwell2}
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{j}\) is the drift current, associated to the moving free charges.\\
In the electro--quasi--static regime, introducing the electric potential \(\varphi\) it hods

\begin{equation} 
	\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \varphi.
	\label{eq:Epotential}
\end{equation}

Inside a dielectric material we have:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_{0} \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}
	\label{eq:D_composition}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
	\label{eq:Ecurrent}
\end{equation}
where \(\sigma\) is the material conductivity.\\
For now we only consider instantaneous polarization of the material, so that 
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P} = \chi \mathbf{E}
\end{equation}
where \(\chi\) is the electric susceptibility. Now
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{D} = \left( \varepsilon_0+\chi\right)\mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r\mathbf{E}
	\label{eq:DandE}
\end{equation}
where \(\epsilon_r\) is the relative permittivity.\\
By substituting \eqref{eq:DandE} in \eqref{eq:Maxwell1}, using also \eqref{eq:Epotential}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LEVEL0a}
	- \mathrm{div}\ \left( \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}\ \nabla \varphi
	\right)  = \rho
\end{equation}
On the other hand if we apply the divergence operator to \eqref{eq:Maxwell2} the l.h.s vanishes, while on the r.h.s. we derive from \eqref{eq:Maxwell1}--\eqref{eq:Epotential}--\eqref{eq:Ecurrent}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LEVEL0b}
	\dfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} - \mathrm{div} \left(  \sigma \nabla \varphi\right) = 0
\end{equation}
Equations \eqref{eq:LEVEL0a}--\eqref{eq:LEVEL0b} together represent the simplest model for a dielectric material.
\subsection{Slow polarization}
The simple model just presented is valid as long as we only have instantaneous response of the material to the electric stimulus. Unfortunately this is rare, and non instantaneous response cannot be neglected in HVDC insulation systems. In other words the relation between \(\mathbf{P}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) is not local in time and could be written as \begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P}(t) = \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^{t}\chi(t-\tau)\mathbf{E}(\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau
\end{equation}
This delayed response is usually treated with the so called Debye relaxation models. We consider \(\mathbf{P}\) to be the combination resulting from different polarization processes
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P}_\infty +\sum_k \mathbf{P}_k
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{P}_\infty = \chi_\infty \mathbf{E}\) is the instantaneous polarization, and for each \(k\) it hods
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Polprocess}
	\tau_{k}\ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{P}_{k} =
	- \left( \varepsilon_{0} \chi_{k} \nabla \varphi + \mathbf{P}_{k}\right).
\end{equation}
Now we need same care to introduce these new equations to model \eqref{eq:LEVEL0a}--\eqref{eq:LEVEL0b}. Setting \(\pi_k = \mathrm{div}\mathbf{P}_k\) and 
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\infty \mathbf{E} + \sum_k \mathbf{P}_k
\end{equation}
with similar substitutions as in the previous case we obtain the following model which has been implemented in this work.\\
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:finalmodel}
	\begin{alignat}{2}[left=\empheqlbrace]
		\dfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} & - \mathrm{div} \left( \sigma \nabla \varphi\right) &&= 0\\[3mm]
		%%
		&- \mathrm{div}\ \left( \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\infty}\ \nabla \varphi
		\right) - \rho +  \sum_{k} \pi_{k} &&= 0\\[3mm]
		%%
		\tau_k	\dfrac{\partial \pi_{k} }{\partial t} &+ \mathrm{div}\ \left(\varepsilon_{0} \chi_{k}\ \nabla \varphi
		\right) + \pi_{k} &&= 0
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Note that we renamed \(\varepsilon_r\) to \(\varepsilon_\infty\), since permittivity now depends on the frequency.
\subsection{Conductivity}
In general, conductivity depends on electric field intensity and temperature. An appropriate model follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conductivitymodel}
	\sigma = (1-a)\ \sigma_{1} \left(|\nabla \varphi|, T \right) +
	a\ \sigma_{0} \left( T \right)
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conductivitymodelaux}
	\tau_{a} \dfrac{\partial a}{\partial t} = \bar{a}\left(|\nabla \varphi|\right) - a.
\end{equation}

\[
\bar{a} = \begin{cases}
	0, \; |\nabla \varphi| > e_{tr}\\[3mm]
	1, \; |\nabla \varphi| \le e_{tr}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\dfrac{1}{\tau_{a}} = \begin{cases}
	\dfrac{\kappa+1}{c}\ \sqrt[\kappa+1]{a(t)}, \; |\nabla \varphi| > e_{tr}\\[3mm]
	\dfrac{1}{\bar{\tau}_{a}}, \; |\nabla \varphi| \le e_{tr}
\end{cases}
\]
where \(\bar{a}\), \(e_{tr}\), \(\kappa\), \(c\) and \(\bar{\tau}_a\) are physical constants of the material. Therefore, modeling \(\sigma\) leads to an additional differential equation to \eqref{eq:finalmodel}.
\subsection{Trapping and de-trapping}
Model \eqref{eq:finalmodel} gives good results when applied to MI paper insulation systems. However it fails with polymeric materials, as new dynamics arise.\\
Here a characteristic phenomenon are the charge deep traps, which are thought to have chemical origin. This leads to an ad-hoc treatment of the free charge density:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:freechargetraps}
	\rho = q\,(p-n-b)
\end{equation}
where \(q\) is the positive elementary charge, \(n\) are the negative mobile charges per unit volume, \(p\) are the positively charged trap states per unit volume and \(b\) are the negative trapped charges, always per unit volume. \(p\) is assumed fixed in time
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}
Trapping and de-trapping of \(b\) needs instead to be modeled. Depth of traps can be ideally associated to the amount of energy required to extract a retained particle. Experiments suggest that the distribution of the density of states (DOS)  for deep traps is a superposition of Gaussian distributions. However to limit the complexity, we assume here single Gaussian distribution:
\begin{equation}
	g(x) = \dfrac{N}{\alpha \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( -\dfrac{\left(x+\Delta \mathcal{E}\right)^{2}}
	{2 \alpha^{2}} \right)
\end{equation}
where \(N\) represents the total number of charges that deep traps can retain per unit volume. \(\Delta \mathcal{E}\) represents the mean trap depth, and \(\alpha^2\) its variance.\\
It is reasonable to assume that charges fill the deeper traps first. Thus we can express the amount of trapped charges \(b\) as a function of the max level of energy \(\mathcal{E}_{max}\):
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{b}{N} = \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}} \dfrac{g(x)}{N}\, \mathrm{d}x =
	\mathop{\int_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}}} \frac{1}{\alpha \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( -\dfrac{\left(x+\Delta \mathcal{E}\right)^{2}}
	{2 \alpha^{2}} \right)\mathrm{d}x
	=: F\left(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}\right)
\end{equation}
Knowing \(\Delta \mathcal{E}\) and \(\alpha\), we can define \(\mathcal{E}_\mathrm{av}\) the average occupied level of energy and relate it to \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}\):
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{av}} := \dfrac{\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}} x\ g(x)\, \mathrm{d}x} {\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}} g(x)\, \mathrm{d}x} =:
	\Gamma\left(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{max}}\right)
\end{equation}
Then, trivially:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{av}} = \Gamma\left(F^{-1}\left(\dfrac{b}{N}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
Charge trapping rate depends on how many trap states are unoccupied, on the drift current, and on the traps cross-section \(c_s\)[\(\mathrm{m}^2\)]:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trap}
	\dot{b}_c = c_s|\mathbf{j}|(N-b)
\end{equation}
While charge trapping begins as soon as the voltage is turned on, de-trapping is typically a slower process: the rate at which charges escape from traps depends on the occupied energy level. In the proposed model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:detrap}
	\dot{b}_e = w_0\ b\ \exp \left(\dfrac{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{av}} \left( \dfrac{b}{N}\right) + \Delta \mathcal{E}}{\kappa_\mathrm{B} T }\right) =: w\left(\dfrac{b}{N}\right)b
\end{equation}
where \(w_0\) is the attempt-to-escape rate when states are full, \(T\) is the temperature and \(\kappa_\mathrm{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant.\\
Combining \eqref{eq:trap}--\eqref{eq:detrap}:
\begin{equation}
	\dot{b} = \dot{b}_c -\dot{b}_e = c_s|\mathbf{j}|(N-b) - w_0\ b\ \exp \left(\dfrac{\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{av}} \left( \dfrac{b}{N}\right) + 
		\Delta \mathcal{E}}{\kappa_\mathrm{B} T }\right)
\end{equation}
Finally, combining all the elements introduced so far, the following model is derived:

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:fullmodel1}
	\begin{align}[left=\empheqlbrace]
		&- \mathrm{div}\ \left( \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\infty}\ \nabla \varphi
		\right)  = q \left( p - n - b \right) -  \sum_{k} \pi_{k} \\[2.5mm]
		%%
		&\dfrac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \mathrm{div} \left(  \dfrac{\sigma}{q} \nabla \varphi\right) =
		- c_s|\mathbf{j}| \left(N - b\right) +
		w \left( \dfrac{b}{N}\right) \ b\\[2.5mm]
		%%
		&\dfrac{\partial b}{\partial t} = c_s |\mathbf{j}| \left(N - b\right) - 
		w \left( \dfrac{b}{N}\right) \ b \\[2.5mm]
		%%
		&\tau_{i}\ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \pi_{i} =
		\dfrac{\chi_{i}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \left( q \left( p - n - b \right) -  
		\sum_{k} \pi_{k} \right) - \pi_{i}\\[2.5mm]
		%%
		&\tau_{a} \dfrac{\partial a}{\partial t} = \bar{a}\left(|\nabla \varphi|\right) - a
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fullmodel2}
	\begin{cases}
		\sigma = (1-a)\ \sigma_{1} \left(|\nabla \varphi|, T \right) +
		a\ \sigma_{0} \left( T \right)\\[3mm]
		\bar{a} = \begin{cases}
			0, \; |\nabla \varphi| > e_{tr}\\[3mm]
			1, \; |\nabla \varphi| \le e_{tr}
		\end{cases}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Note that starting from \eqref{eq:fullmodel1}--\eqref{eq:fullmodel2} and taking the following assumptions:
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
	a = 0\\
	N\rightarrow 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
we retrieve \eqref{eq:finalmodel}
\subsection{Boundary conditions}
We briefly discuss typical boundary conditions for \eqref{eq:finalmodel}.\\
The only variable appearing under space differential operator is the electric potential \(\varphi\). Therefore it as also the only variable to which b.c. are meaningful. Typically the dielectric is interposed between different contacts at different voltages. It comes natural to impose Dirichlet b.c. on the contacts. On the other sides of the domain natural b.c. are adopted:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LEVEL1Bc}
	\begin{cases}
		\left.\varphi\right|_{\Gamma_D} = \varphi_D \\[3mm]
		-\left.\left(\sigma \nabla  \varphi \cdot n\right)\right|_{\Gamma_N} = 0
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Equations}
\label{sec:eqs}
This section gives some examples of writing mathematical equations in your thesis.

Maxwell's equations read:
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:maxwell}
    \begin{align}[left=\empheqlbrace]
    \nabla\cdot \bm{D} & = \rho, \label{eq:maxwell1} \\
    \nabla \times \bm{E} +  \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} & = \bm{0}, \label{eq:maxwell2} \\
    \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \label{eq:maxwell3} \\
    \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J}. \label{eq:maxwell4}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell} is automatically labeled by \texttt{cleveref},
as well as Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell1} and Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell3}.
Thanks to the \verb|cleveref| package, there is no need to use \verb|\eqref|.
Equations have to be numbered only if they are referenced in the text.

Equations~\eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels1}, \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels2}, \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels3}, and \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels4} show again Maxwell's equations without brace:
\begin{align}
    \nabla\cdot \bm{D} & = \rho, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels1} \\
    \nabla \times \bm{E} +  \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} &= \bm{0}, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels2} \\
    \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels3} \\
    \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J} \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels4}.
\end{align}

Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell_singlelabel} is the same as before,
but with just one label:

    \begin{aligned}

    \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \\
    \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J}.

    \centering
    \subfloat[One PoliMi logo.\label{fig:polimi_logo1}]{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/logo_polimi_scritta.eps}
    }
    \quad
    \subfloat[Another one PoliMi logo.\label{fig:polimi_logo2}]{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/logo_polimi_scritta2.eps}
    }
    \caption[]{Caption of the Figure.}
    \label{fig:quadtree2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:tables}

Within the environments \texttt{table} and  \texttt{tabular} you can create very fancy tables as the one shown in Table~\ref{table:example}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption*{\textbf{Example of Table (optional)}}
    \centering 
    \begin{tabular}{|p{3em} c c c |}
    \hline
    \rowcolor{bluePoli!40}
     & \textbf{column1} & \textbf{column2} & \textbf{column3} \T\B \\
    \hline \hline
    \textbf{row1} & 1 & 2 & 3 \T\B \\
    \textbf{row2} & $\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ \T\B\\
    \textbf{row3} & alpha & beta & gamma \B\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \\[10pt]
    \caption{Caption of the Table.}
    \label{table:example}
\end{table}

You can also consider to highlight selected columns or rows in order to make tables more readable.
Moreover, with the use of \texttt{table*} and the option \texttt{bp} it is possible to align them at the bottom of the page. One example is presented in Table~\ref{table:exampleC}. 

\begin{table*}[bp]
\centering 
    \begin{tabular}{|p{3em} | c | c | c | c | c | c|}
    \hline
%    \rowcolor{bluePoli!40}
     & \textbf{column1} & \textbf{column2} & \textbf{column3} & \textbf{column4} & \textbf{column5} & \textbf{column6} \T\B \\
    \hline \hline
    \textbf{row1} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \T\B\\
    \textbf{row2} & a & b & c & d & e & f \T\B\\
    \textbf{row3} & $\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ & $\delta$ & $\phi$ & $\omega$ \T\B\\
    \textbf{row4} & alpha & beta & gamma & delta & phi & omega \B\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \\[10pt]
    \caption{Highlighting the columns}
    \label{table:exampleC}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Algorithms}
\label{subsec:algorithms}

Pseudo-algorithms can be written in \LaTeX{} with the \texttt{algorithm} and \texttt{algorithmic} packages.
An example is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:var}.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\label{alg:example}
\caption{Name of the Algorithm}
\label{alg:var}
\label{protocol1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initial instructions
\FOR{$for-condition$}
\STATE{Some instructions}
\IF{$if-condition$}
\STATE{Some other instructions}
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\WHILE{$while-condition$}
\STATE{Some further instructions}
\ENDWHILE
\STATE Final instructions
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} 

\section{Some further useful suggestions}

Theorems have to be formatted as follows:
\begin{theorem}
\label{a_theorem}
Write here your theorem. 
\end{theorem}
\textit{Proof.} If useful you can report here the proof.
\vspace{0.3cm} % Insert vertical space

Propositions have to be formatted as follows:
\begin{proposition}
Write here your proposition.
\end{proposition}
\vspace{0.3cm} % Insert vertical space

How to insert itemized lists:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first item;
    \item second item.
\end{itemize}
How to write numbered lists:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item first item;
    \item second item.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use of copyrighted material}

Each student is responsible for obtaining copyright permissions, if necessary, to include published material in the thesis.
This applies typically to third-party material published by someone else.

\section{Plagiarism}

You have to be sure to respect the rules on Copyright and avoid an involuntary plagiarism.
It is allowed to take other persons' ideas only if the author and his original work are clearly mentioned.
As stated in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, Politecnico di Milano \textit{promotes the integrity of research,
condemns manipulation and the infringement of intellectual property}, and gives opportunity to all those
who carry out research activities to have an adequate training on ethical conduct and integrity while doing research.
To be sure to respect the copyright rules, read the guides on Copyright legislation and citation styles available
at:

% CONCLUSION
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions}
\color{black}
A final section containing the main conclusions of your research/study
and possible future developments of your work have to be inserted in the section ``Conclusions''.

\section{Bibliography and citations}
Your thesis must contain a suitable Bibliography which lists all the sources consulted on developing the work.
The list of references is placed at the end of the manuscript after the chapter containing the conclusions.
It is suggested to use the BibTeX package and save the bibliographic references in the file \verb|bibliography.bib|.
This is indeed a database containing all the information about the references. To cite in your manuscript, use the \verb|\cite{}| command as follows:
\\
\textit{Here is how you cite bibliography entries: \cite{knuth74}, or multiple ones at once: \cite{knuth92,lamport94}}.
\\
The bibliography and list of references are generated automatically by running BibTeX \cite{bibtex}.

\appendix
\section{Appendix A}
If you need to include an appendix to support the research in your thesis, you can place it at the end of the manuscript.
An appendix contains supplementary material (figures, tables, data, codes, mathematical proofs, surveys, \dots)
which supplement the main results contained in the previous sections.

\section{Appendix B}
It may be necessary to include another appendix to better organize the presentation of supplementary material.
